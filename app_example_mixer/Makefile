# The TARGET variable determines what target system the application is 
# compiled for. It either refers to an XN file in the source directories
# or a valid argument for the --target option when compiling.


# This example runs on the XS-L1 usb audio board. It doesn't use any of
# the audio functionality and just uses the USB functionality of the board
TARGET = usb_audio_s1

# The APP_NAME variable determines the name of the final .xe file. It should
# not include the .xe postfix. If left blank the name will default to 
# the project name
APP_NAME = app_example_mixer

# The flags passed to xcc when building the application
# You can also set the following to override flags for a particular language:
#
#    XCC_XC_FLAGS, XCC_C_FLAGS, XCC_ASM_FLAGS, XCC_CPP_FLAGS
#
# If the variable XCC_MAP_FLAGS is set it overrides the flags passed to 
# xcc for the final link (mapping) stage.
XCC_FLAGS = -Wall -O3 -report -g

# The USED_MODULES variable lists other module used by the application. 
USED_MODULES = module_audio_mixer
